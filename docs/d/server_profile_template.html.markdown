* `name` - (Required) A unique name for the resource.

* `affinity` - (Optional) This identifies the behavior of the server profiles created from this template when the server 
hardware is removed or replaced. This can be set to Bay or BayAndServer. 
This defaults to Bay.
  
* `boot_order`- (Optional) Defines the order in which boot will be attempted on the available devices. Different hardware
